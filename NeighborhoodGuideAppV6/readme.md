PubCrawl - The App for Bars
—————————————————————————

This app lets the user search for different bars in the Berkeley neighborhood.
The user can search using one of three different search criteria.
Bars can be stored in a favorites list for easy access.
—————————————————————————

Bugs:
-In the first screen, the user cannot select different cities at the moment
-The user can only search for bars by using only one of the three search criteria
The beer.
-In the search results activity the Beer button in the action bar does not take the 
user back home like it’s suppose to.
